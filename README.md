## Employee Attrition

This project aims to gain insight on employee attrition and what impacts it.
Job Role, Job Satisfaction, Education Field, Monthly Income, and Over Time were
the main variables looked at in this analys.

Two prediction models were built.
The first model was a classifier that consisted of an ensemble of three 
k Nearest Neighbors models and three Naive Bayes models. These models were then 
averaged to create the final classifier.

The second model was a multiple linear regression model that was built to predict
monthly income.

All of the data, code, and slides are contained in this repo.
